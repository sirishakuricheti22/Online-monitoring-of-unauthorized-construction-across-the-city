# Online-monitoring-of-unauthorized-construction-across-the-city
This project aims to develop a smart, real-time system to monitor and detect illegal construction activities across cities. It allows users to submit images, locations, and reports of suspected violations through a user-friendly portal. Authorities can verify, track, and manage these reports with improved efficiency.
